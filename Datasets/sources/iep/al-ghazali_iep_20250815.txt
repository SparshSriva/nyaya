Summary (research notes)
- Method of doubt: sensory and dream skepticism; ultimate resolution via a divine light that grounds certainty.
- Incoherence of the Philosophers: critiques on eternity of the world, God’s knowledge of particulars, bodily resurrection; charges unbelief on some issues.
- Causation and occasionalism: created things do not necessitate effects; God creates conjunctions regularly (habit/custom), enabling science without necessity.
- Ethical/Sufi integration: intellectual humility, purification of the heart, practical ethics.

Key points (bullets)
- Doubt is a pedagogical step, not an endpoint; certainty is possible through a higher light.
- Occasionalism reframes causation as dependence on divine will; fire does not intrinsically burn cotton.
- Practical spirituality informs epistemology and ethics.
