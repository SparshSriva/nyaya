Summary (research notes)
- Ren (co-humanity/humaneness): central virtue expressed in considerate relations, empathy, and reciprocity.
- Li (ritual propriety): embodied social norms and practices that cultivate virtue and sustain order.
- Junzi (profound person): moral exemplar who leads by virtue (de), aligning self-cultivation with social harmony.
- Tian (Heaven): a moral order and source of legitimacy; rulers must align with it through virtue.

Key points (bullets)
- Self-cultivation precedes governance; order flows from character.
- Ritual is formative, not mere ceremony; it shapes desires and conduct.
- Moral force (de) is more effective than coercion.
