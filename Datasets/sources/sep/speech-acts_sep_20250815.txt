Summary (research notes)
- Core distinction: propositional content (what is said) vs illocutionary force (what is done in saying it).
- Felicity conditions: social/linguistic preconditions for successful performance (authority, procedure, sincerity, uptake).
- Direction of fit: mind-to-world (asserting, describing) vs world-to-mind (promising, commanding) vs double-fit acts.
- Indirect speech acts: one utterance carries multiple forces; inferred via shared conventions and context.
- Force indicators and scorekeeping: conventional devices (mood, performatives) + pragmatic score updates track commitments.
- Logical systems model act-types, inferential relations, and commitment dynamics.

Key points (bullets)
- Performative vs constative is not a strict dichotomy; many utterances do both.
- Searle & Vanderveken analyze force into components (illocutionary point, mode of achievement, strength, etc.).
- Conditions of satisfaction and direction of fit explain success/failure of different act kinds.
- Social dimensions: illocutionary silencing and authority relations affect uptake and success.
