- **Rigor**: Ensure logical validity in each step
- **Depth**: Address substantive philosophical problems, not trivial claims  
- **Originality**: Create novel combinations and fresh perspectives
- **Authority**: Reference legitimate academic sources and theoretical frameworks

## **Standardized Pipeline (Must Follow Each Batch)**
1) Source capture and archiving
   - Save paraphrased research notes (no full texts) to `Datasets/sources/<provider>/` as `<slug>_<provider>_<YYYYMMDD>.txt` with URL and access date.
2) Drafting in staging
   - Add entries to `nyaya_corpus_staging.jsonl` (strict JSONL; required fields: domain, pratijna, hetu, udaharana, upanaya, nigamana, grounding_authority). Use authority format: `Field / Specific Source, <URL> (accessed YYYY-MM-DD)`.
3) Validation via notebook
   - Temporarily point `corpus_analysis.ipynb` to the staging file and verify:
     - Average complexity ≥ 8
     - ≥ 25% Non‑Western in the batch
     - Source specificity target ≥ 90%
     - 100% schema compliance (no missing fields)
4) Integration
   - Merge validated entries into `nyaya_corpus_clean.jsonl`; keep original corpus for provenance.
   - Regenerate `corpus_statistics.json` and review domain/authority metrics.
5) Logging and documentation
   - Append a dated section to `AGENT_LOG.md` listing changes, design decisions, deviations, and next steps.

## Artifacts Created (Reference)
- `Datasets/README.md` — structure, naming, and quality gates
- `Datasets/instructions/RESEARCH_SOP.md` — research/drafting SOP
- `Datasets/scripts/requirements.txt`, `Datasets/scripts/fetch_source.py` — source fetch utilities
- `Datasets/sources/sep/speech-acts_sep_20250815.txt` — SEP notes
- `Datasets/sources/iep/al-ghazali_iep_20250815.txt`, `Datasets/sources/iep/confucius_iep_20250815.txt` — IEP notes

## Rationale
- Ensures reproducibility, legal compliance, and traceability; improves RAG performance via specific grounding authorities and hierarchical domains; enforces cultural balance.

## **Quality Assurance**:
- Each syllogism must be logically valid (conclusion follows from premises)
- Universal principles (udaharana) must be genuinely universal, not cherry-picked
- Examples should be compelling and well-known within their domains
- Grounding authorities must be legitimate academic sources
- Domain classifications should reflect genuine scholarly fields

## **Critical Success Factors**

### **What Makes This Dataset Valuable**:
1. **Philosophical Sophistication**: Real philosophical problems, not simplified versions
2. **Logical Rigor**: Valid reasoning patterns that model good thinking
3. **Domain Diversity**: Breadth prevents overfitting to specific reasoning styles  
4. **Contradictory Perspectives**: Forces AI to navigate genuine disagreement
5. **Cultural Breadth**: Multiple wisdom traditions and ways of knowing

### **Avoid These Pitfalls**:
- Superficial treatments of deep problems
- False or misleading claims presented as examples
- Insufficient grounding in legitimate academic sources
- Cultural appropriation or misrepresentation of non-Western traditions
- Logical fallacies or invalid reasoning structures

## **LONG-TERM VISION: SOTA Model Fine-tuning Architecture**

### **Dynamic Learning Awareness System**
The Nyāya corpus is being designed for future SOTA models with sophisticated learning dynamics:

#### **Adaptive Loss Function Design**:
```python
# Conceptual loss function for knowledge-aware fine-tuning
def knowledge_aware_loss(predictions, targets, knowledge_state):
    """
    Loss function that increases when model encounters genuinely new concepts,
    decreases as it masters known domains, creating dynamic learning signals.
    """
    base_loss = cross_entropy(predictions, targets)
    
    # Novelty detection component
    novelty_score = detect_conceptual_novelty(targets, knowledge_state)
    
    # Uncertainty awareness component  
    epistemic_uncertainty = estimate_epistemic_uncertainty(predictions)
    
    # Meta-cognitive component (knowing what you don't know)
    confidence_calibration = calibration_error(predictions, targets)
    
    # Dynamic learning signal
    learning_signal = base_loss + (novelty_score * learning_rate) + epistemic_uncertainty
    
    return learning_signal, {
        'base_loss': base_loss,
        'novelty_discovered': novelty_score > threshold,
        'knowledge_expansion': update_knowledge_map(targets, knowledge_state),
        'meta_learning_signal': confidence_calibration
    }
```

#### **Knowledge State Tracking**:

- **Conceptual Boundary Detection**: Identify when model encounters genuinely new ideas
- **Cross-Domain Transfer Monitoring**: Measure knowledge application across fields
- **Cultural Knowledge Gaps**: Detect Western vs Non-Western philosophical understanding disparities

### **Source Quality Integration Architecture**

#### **Hierarchical Source Authority System**:
Future SOTA models will directly query and evaluate sources with multi-layered authority assessment:

```python
# Conceptual source quality architecture
class SourceAuthorityEvaluator:
    def evaluate_source_quality(self, source, domain, cultural_context):
        """
        Multi-dimensional source quality assessment for direct model querying.
        """
        quality_metrics = {
            'academic_authority': self.assess_scholarly_standing(source),
            'cultural_authenticity': self.verify_cultural_representation(source, cultural_context),
            'philosophical_rigor': self.evaluate_argument_structure(source),
            'contemporary_relevance': self.assess_current_debate_integration(source),
            'cross_cultural_validity': self.check_universal_vs_particular_claims(source),
            'methodological_soundness': self.evaluate_reasoning_quality(source)
        }
        
        # Weight by domain-specific criteria
        domain_weights = self.get_domain_authority_weights(domain)
        
        # Cultural sensitivity adjustment
        cultural_authority = self.assess_insider_vs_outsider_perspective(source, cultural_context)
        
        return weighted_quality_score(quality_metrics, domain_weights, cultural_authority)
```

**Ready for next expansion**: The corpus now has strong foundation across core philosophical domains and is ready for specialized technical areas and continued cultural diversification.

## **Long-Term Vision**
This corpus will train AI systems to engage in sophisticated reasoning across the full spectrum of human intellectual inquiry. The goal is emergent understanding that transcends simple pattern matching—AI that can genuinely grapple with the deepest questions of existence, knowledge, value, and meaning that have driven human intellectual development.

**Remember**: We're not just creating training data; we're encoding the structure of rational thought itself across cultures and domains. Each syllogism should represent a genuine contribution to the AI's capacity for sophisticated reasoning about the fundamental questions that define human intellectual life.
